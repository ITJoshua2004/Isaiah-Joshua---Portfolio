### Projects

#### Project 1: HMI Calculator

Essentially, my code takes the user’s input, their height and weight, and converts this information into the metric system. After it is converted, it inputs this data into an HMI calculator and then outputs the result for the user to view. If the information is above, below, or meets the standard for a good HMI and prints a message out accordingly.

This project was based on a prompt from my professor. This project aims to help people with moderation and facilitate healthy living. Moderation and healthy living can be difficult to maintain, especially without a set goal or reminder. This code lets someone know if their lifestyle is healthy, and if there is a need for adjustment.

For this project I wrote my code using Python3. One of the problems I faced was converting pounds into kilos. As an American, everyone using my code would use pounds or feet/inches for their data, and converting these into the metric system was an obstacle. I eventually found how to implement the formula for converting information into the metric system into my code

I wrote this code completely independently. I didn’t use any outside resources or help.

I emerged successful in my goal, I was able to create a code that calculates a person's HMI and converts the data into the metric system. If I had to rework this code, I would include something that detects whether or not the data the user inputs is already in the metric system so that my code doesn't try to convert something that doesn’t need to be converted.

#### Project 2: Numbers Divisible by 3 and/or 5

What I created was a code that asks the user for an input, prompting them to enter a number to determine whether or not it is divisible by 3 or 5. It’s a loop, and It will continuously ask the user for another number over and over, continuously determining whether or not the number is divisible by a 5 or a 3. It will go on like this until the user inputs the number “0” to quite the program.

This project was based on a prompt from my professor. The point of this project is to determine if a number imputed by the user is divisible for 3 or 5. If a person needs to find random numbers that are divisible by 3 or 5 for a code they’re trying to create it’d be easier to determine upfront with my code rather than meticulously dividing each number by hand.

For this project, I used Python3 to write my code. This code, although simple, was difficult for me to tackle. I couldn’t figure out how to properly dispose of remainders and determine whether or not a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 or is divisible by neither. 

For this code, I got help from one of my classmates, who helped me solve this problem. He showed me how to use modulus (%) and helped me get back on track with the assignment. He helped me overcome this obstacle.

In the end I was able to make a calculator that determines whether or not a number is divisible by 3 or 5 or is divisible by both. If I were to change this code I would add an option that determines if a number is divisible by 7 or not, I know the number 7 is popular so I feel like the odd numbers of 3, 5, and 7, could be used for a random number generator.

#### Project 3: Test Your Ball Knowledge

My code is a ten question quiz that asks a person questions about the game of basketball. Each possible answer has a value assigned to it and at the end of the quiz, my code tallys the values from each answer given by the user and prints out a “ball knowledge” score that tells the user how much they know about basketball.

This project was based on a prompt from my professor. I created this project in order to determine how well a person understands the game of basketball. A lot of people claim they know about the game but this isn’t true, taking my test gives a person a ranking based on their score, determining if they truly have “elite ball knowledge.”

I used Python3 to create this project. One difficulty I came across whilst writing this code was assigning values to the answers given by the user. It was difficult to tally the answers to create a value score. 

I wrote this code completely independently. To circumvent this problem I decided to assign each letter response (A, B, C, and D) a number value. Then I would have the code add up the values to determine a score. This score would then print out a response based on what level of “ball knowledge” the user has.

In the end, I accomplished my task, I created a test that ranks a person's basketball knowledge. If I were to change this test, I would make it more opinion based and less fact based. That way there isn’t a “correct answer.”
